This is a Data Engineering retail reporting project
we get dimension tables from database
we get transaction data from hadoop file daily


1)problem statement
-find average distance from customer home to store per city per date.
-cust sales per day daily
-generate store sales report daily it should have daily sale per store,items sold,
day hour where max sales happend,most sold product,date
-sales person total sales made per day and incentivice them


2)architecture-
-pipeline runs daily as we need daily reports
-dimension tables are on mysql we take it and write on hadoop with scd type 2
-we get fact files from source location (hadoop) (can try with s3 also)
-DQ CHECKS => data cleaning => logic transformation => write on hive => reporting teams consume to
                                                                             build dashboards
#QUICK THOUGHTS
1)make small lookup tables for city citycode,country countrycode
